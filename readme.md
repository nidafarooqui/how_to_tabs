How To: Tabs
=============
This series is by James Shore's [Let's Code: Test-Driven Javascript screencast](http://www.letscodejavascript.com).

"How To: Tabs" is focused on showing beginning programmers how work is done in a professional environment.

This series covers a wide range of topics, including:

* Version Control
* Reproducible builds
* Static code analysis (linting)
* Cross-browser testing
* Javascript modules
* Test-driven development of front-end code
* The Document Object Model
* Design and Refactoring

These techniques are used to develop a tab-switching effect.
